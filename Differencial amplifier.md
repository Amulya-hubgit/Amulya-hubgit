## **DC,Transient Analysis and AC analysis of Diffrencial Amplifier MOSFET**
### **Introduction:**
A MOSFET differential amplifier amplifies the voltage difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode noise. It consists of two matched MOSFETs, a current source, and load resistors or an active load. The MOSFETs share a common bias current, which splits between them based on the input voltages.
<br>
In differential mode, if one input voltage increases while the other decreases, the current through one MOSFET rises while the other falls, creating a voltage difference at the output. In common-mode operation, where both inputs change together, the circuit maintains a balanced current flow, minimizing output variation and rejecting noise.
<br>
Applications of Differential amplifiers are widely used in Operational amplifiers (op-amps),Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs),Sensor signal conditioning,Communication circuits (such as mixers and amplifiers) a due to its high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), high input impedance, and low distortion.
