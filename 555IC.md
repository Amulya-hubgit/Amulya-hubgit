# Design and Simulation of 555 Timer-Based Astable and Monostable Multivibrators for Pulse Generation
### 1. Introduction
<p> A multivibrator is a switching circuit that uses two amplifying stages with positive feedback to generate square waves. It oscillates between HIGH and LOW states and is widely used in digital electronics for timing, data storage, and signal generation.
There are three types: astable , monostable , and bistable.</p>
here is the pin diagram of **IC 555**
