# Design and Simulation of 555 Timer-Based Astable and Monostable Multivibrators for Pulse Generation
### 1. Introduction
<p> A multivibrator is a switching circuit that uses two amplifying stages with positive feedback to generate square waves. It oscillates between HIGH and LOW states and is widely used in digital electronics for timing, data storage, and signal generation.
<p></p>There are three types: astable , monostable , and bistable.</p>

### 2. AIM
Generate a waveform with pulse width of 0.5 ms under different trigger conditions using 555 timer IC.
### 3. Working Principal
The 555 Timer IC operates in monostable mode by generating a single output pulse when triggered. In this mode, the timer has one stable state (LOW) and one temporary state (HIGH).
<p>When a negative trigger pulse (voltage less than 1/3 Vcc) is applied to pin 2, the internal comparator sets the flip-flop, causing the output at pin 3 to go HIGH. Simultaneously, a capacitor connected between pin 6 (threshold) and ground begins charging through a resistor connected to Vcc.</p>
<p>The output remains HIGH for a duration defined by:</p>
<p>T = 1.1 × R × C</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>T is the pulse width in seconds</p>
<p>R is the resistance in ohms (Ω)</p>
<p>C is the capacitance in farads (F)</p>
<p>Once the capacitor charges to 2/3 of the supply voltage (Vcc), the second internal comparator resets the flip-flop, and the output goes LOW again, returning the timer to its stable state.</p>

#### Target pulse width:

*T = 0.5 ms*

monostable formula:
*T = 1.1 x R x C*
*Assumme:*
- C = 1 µF
Then:
*R = T/1.1 x C = 454.54 Ω*

resistor and capacitor values:
- R = 454.54 Ω
- C = 1 µF
These values yield a pulse duration of approximately 0.5 ms.
### 5. Simulation Analysis
### <ins>Transient Analysis
 Simulation Command
   - Go to **Simulate** -> *Edit Simulation Cmd*
   - Choose **Transient**, and set thime as needed per case.

Used to verify timing behaviour of the output signal in response to various trigger signals


### 6. Output Waveforms
### <ins>Case 1: Properly Spaced Triggers
- Trigger Pulse Source:
  VTrig PULSE(5 0 0.05m 0 0 0.01m 2m)
  - This generates a falling edge every 2 ms (well spaced).

- Run the simulation for 10 ms.

First waveform is the output of trigger input, Second is the output of capacitor voltage and third waveform is the output of monostable multivibrator with pulse width of 0.5 ms. 

**Output Result**:
  -The input trigger just initiates the output change.
  -The duration of the output pulse (HIGH or LOW) is determined by the values of the resistor (R) and capacitor (C) in the timing circuit, 
    not by the trigger pulse width.
  - Each falling edge triggers the 555.
  - Output (VOUT) goes HIGH for approx. 0.5 ms on each trigger.
  - Multiple output pulses will be seen.

### <ins>Case 2: Rapid Repeated Triggers
- Trigger Pulse Source:
  VTrig PULSE(5 0 0.05m 0 0 0.01m 0.2m)
  - This generates a falling edge every 0.2 ms (faster than output duration).

- Run the simulation for 2 ms.

First waveform is the output of trigger input, Second is the output of capacitor voltage and third waveform is the output of monostable multivibrator with pulse width of 0.5 ms. 
**Output Result**:
- The first trigger sets the output HIGH.
- Any subsequent triggers during the HIGH output are ignored.The output stays HIGH for exactly 0.5 ms, then goes LOW.
### 7. INFERENCE
-Accurate Pulse Generation: The 555 timer in monostable mode generates a precise 0.5 ms output pulse for each valid falling-edge trigger. In Case 1 (triggers every 2 ms), the circuit produces clean and well-timed output pulses, with the capacitor voltage waveform confirming proper charge and discharge behavior.
- Non-Retriggerable Operation and Reliability: In Case 2 (triggers every 0.2 ms), the timer exhibits its non-retriggerable nature by ignoring triggers that occur during the HIGH output phase. Simulation results align with theoretical expectations, demonstrating the circuit’s reliable performance under both slow and rapid triggering conditions.
### 8. CONCLUSION  
The 555 timer IC, configured in monostable mode, successfully generates a stable 0.5 ms output pulse in response to falling-edge triggers. Under well-spaced trigger conditions, the output pulses are distinct and accurately timed. When the trigger frequency exceeds the pulse duration, the timer maintains its non-retriggerable behavior by ignoring additional triggers during the active output phase. This confirms the timer’s reliability and predictable operation across varying trigger conditions, validating its effectiveness in timing and pulse-generation applications.
