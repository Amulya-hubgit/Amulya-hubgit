# Design and Simulation of 555 Timer-Based Astable and Monostable Multivibrators for Pulse Generation
### 1. Introduction
<p> A multivibrator is a switching circuit that uses two amplifying stages with positive feedback to generate square waves. It oscillates between HIGH and LOW states and is widely used in digital electronics for timing, data storage, and signal generation.
<p></p>There are three types: astable , monostable , and bistable.</p>

### 2. AIM
Generate a waveform with pulse width of 0.5 ms under different trigger conditions using 555 timer IC.
### 3. Working Principal
The 555 Timer IC operates in monostable mode by generating a single output pulse when triggered. In this mode, the timer has one stable state (LOW) and one temporary state (HIGH).
<p>When a negative trigger pulse (voltage less than 1/3 Vcc) is applied to pin 2, the internal comparator sets the flip-flop, causing the output at pin 3 to go HIGH. Simultaneously, a capacitor connected between pin 6 (threshold) and ground begins charging through a resistor connected to Vcc.</p>
<p>The output remains HIGH for a duration defined by:</p>
<p>T = 1.1 × R × C</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>T is the pulse width in seconds</p>
<p>R is the resistance in ohms (Ω)</p>
<p>C is the capacitance in farads (F)</p>
<p>Once the capacitor charges to 2/3 of the supply voltage (Vcc), the second internal comparator resets the flip-flop, and the output goes LOW again, returning the timer to its stable state.</p>

#### Target pulse width:

*T = 0.5 ms*

monostable formula:
*T = 1.1 x R x C*
Assumme:
- C = 1 µF
Then:
*R = T/1.1 x C = 454.54 Ω*

resistor and capacitor values:
- R = 454.54 Ω
- C = 1 µF
These values yield a pulse duration of approximately 0.5 ms.
