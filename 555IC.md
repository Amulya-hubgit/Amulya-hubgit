# Design and Simulation of 555 Timer-Based Astable and Monostable Multivibrators for Pulse Generation
### 1. Introduction
<p> A multivibrator is a switching circuit that uses two amplifying stages with positive feedback to generate square waves. It oscillates between HIGH and LOW states and is widely used in digital electronics for timing, data storage, and signal generation.
<p></p>There are three types: astable , monostable , and bistable.</p>

### 2. AIM
Generate a waveform with pulse width of 0.5 ms under different trigger conditions using 555 timer IC.
### 3. Working Principal
The 555 Timer IC operates in monostable mode by generating a single output pulse when triggered. In this mode, the timer has one stable state (LOW) and one temporary state (HIGH).
<p>When a negative trigger pulse (voltage less than 1/3 Vcc) is applied to pin 2, the internal comparator sets the flip-flop, causing the output at pin 3 to go HIGH. Simultaneously, a capacitor connected between pin 6 (threshold) and ground begins charging through a resistor connected to Vcc.</p>
<p>The output remains HIGH for a duration defined by:</p>
<p>T = 1.1 × R × C</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>T is the pulse width in seconds</p>
<p>R is the resistance in ohms (Ω)</p>
<p>C is the capacitance in farads (F)</p>
<p>Once the capacitor charges to 2/3 of the supply voltage (Vcc), the second internal comparator resets the flip-flop, and the output goes LOW again, returning the timer to its stable state.</p>

#### Target pulse width:

*T = 0.5 ms*

monostable formula:
*T = 1.1 x R x C*
*Assumme:*
- C = 1 µF
Then:
*R = T/1.1 x C = 454.54 Ω*

resistor and capacitor values:
- R = 454.54 Ω
- C = 1 µF
These values yield a pulse duration of approximately 0.5 ms.

   - Go to **Simulate** -> *Edit Simulation Cmd*
   - Choose **Transient**, and set time .

Used to verify timing behaviour of the output signal in response to various trigger signals


### 6. Output Waveforms
### <ins>Case 1: Properly Spaced Triggers
- Trigger Pulse Source:
  VTrig PULSE(5 0 0.05m 0 0 0.01m 2m)
  - This generates a falling edge every 2 ms (well spaced).

- Run the simulation for 10 ms.

First waveform is the output of trigger input, Second is the output of capacitor voltage and third waveform is the output of monostable multivibrator with pulse width of 0.5 ms. 

**Output Result**:
  -The input trigger just initiates the output change.
  -The duration of the output pulse (HIGH or LOW) is determined by the values of the resistor (R) and capacitor (C) in the timing circuit, 
    not by the trigger pulse width.
  - Each falling edge triggers the 555.
  - Output (VOUT) goes HIGH for approx. 0.5 ms on each trigger.
  - Multiple output pulses will be seen.

### <ins>Case 2: Rapid Repeated Triggers
- Trigger Pulse Source:
  VTrig PULSE(5 0 0.05m 0 0 0.01m 0.2m)
  - This generates a falling edge every 0.2 ms (faster than output duration).

- Run the simulation for 2 ms.

First waveform is the output of trigger input, Second is the output of capacitor voltage and third waveform is the output of monostable multivibrator with pulse width of 0.5 ms. 

**Output Result**:
- The first trigger sets the output HIGH.
- Any subsequent triggers during the HIGH output are ignored.The output stays HIGH for exactly 0.5 ms, then goes LOW.
### 7. Inference
-Accurate Pulse Generation: The 555 timer in monostable mode generates a precise 0.5 ms output pulse for each valid falling-edge trigger. In Case 1 (triggers every 2 ms), the circuit produces clean and well-timed output pulses, with the capacitor voltage waveform confirming proper charge and discharge behavior.
- Non-Retriggerable Operation and Reliability: In Case 2 (triggers every 0.2 ms), the timer exhibits its non-retriggerable nature by ignoring triggers that occur during the HIGH output phase. Simulation results align with theoretical expectations, demonstrating the circuit’s reliable performance under both slow and rapid triggering conditions.
### 8. Conclusion 
The 555 timer IC, configured in monostable mode, successfully generates a stable 0.5 ms output pulse in response to falling-edge triggers. Under well-spaced trigger conditions, the output pulses are distinct and accurately timed. When the trigger frequency exceeds the pulse duration, the timer maintains its non-retriggerable behavior by ignoring additional triggers during the active output phase. This confirms the timer’s reliability and predictable operation across varying trigger conditions, validating its effectiveness in timing and pulse-generation applications.

# Astable Multivibrator And Monostable Multivibrator Using 555 Timer ICs
### 1. AIM
Generate a waveform with pulse width of 0.5 ms under different trigger conditions using 555 timer IC.
### 2. THEORY
An Astable Multivibrator is a circuit that oscillates between two unstable states on its own, without the need for any external trigger. It generates a continuous square wave output, which makes it useful for applications such as clock pulses, waveform generation, and frequency synthesis.

The 555 timer IC is commonly used to build an astable multivibrator. In this mode, the timer repeatedly charges and discharges a capacitor through resistors, creating a repeating square wave signal.
### <ins>Logic Structure Used
To achieve reliable triggering of the monostable 555 timer, the following setup is used:

- The Astable Multivibrator produces a steady square wave signal.

- A Differentiator Circuit converts the rising and falling edges of the square wave into narrow voltage spikes.

- A Clipper Circuit filters out positive spikes and allows only negative spikes to pass through.

- The Monostable Multivibrator (555 timer) then generates a fixed-duration pulse of 0.5 ms in response to each negative spike trigger.
### 3. HOW THE ASTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR WORKS
  
  ### 1. Charging state:
 - The capacitor charges through resistors R1 and R2.
 - Once the voltage across the capacitor reaches two-thirds of the supply voltage (2/3 Vcc), an internal comparator flips the output state.
 - As a result, the output switches to LOW.
   ### 2. Discharging state:
   - The capacitor discharges through resistor R2 only, via pin 7 of the 555 timer.
   - When the voltage falls to one-third of the supply voltage (1/3 Vcc), the comparator switches the output HIGH again.
   - This charging and discharging cycle repeats continuously.

 ### 4.Circut design and calculations
 ### Astable Multivibrator
*ton = 0.69 (R1 + R2)C2*,   *toff = 0.69 x R1 x C2*
#### <ins>Case 1:
Consider ton = 0.3 ms, toff = 0.2 ms and C2 = 0.01 µF

*R2 = 0.2 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ = 28.985k Ω*

*R1 = (0.3 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ) - 28.985k = 14.493k Ω*

- For ton = 0.3 ms and toff = 0.2 ms, Period = 0.5 ms


#### <ins>Case 2:
Consider ton = 0.7 ms, toff = 0.3 ms and C2 = 0.01 µF

*R2 = 0.3 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ = 43.478k Ω*

*R1 = (0.7 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ) - 43.478k = 57.971k Ω*
#### <ins>Case 3:
Consider ton = 0.1 ms, toff = 0.4 ms and C2 = 0.01 µF
This is not possible as ton must be greater than toff in astable multivibrator. Thus consider ton = 0.4 ms and toff = 0.1 ms and invert the output

*R2 = 0.1 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ = 14.492k Ω*

*R1 = (0.4 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ) - 14.492k = 43.479k Ω*

### Differentiator Circuit
Let C4 = 0.1 µF, fa = 1k Hz and fb = 10k Hz

*fa = 1/2 x pi x R4 x C4*

*R4 = 1/2 x pi x 0.1µ x 10^3 = 1.59k Ω*

*fb = 1/2 x pi x R3 x C4*

*R3 = 1/2 x pi x 0.1µ x 10 x 10^3 = 159 Ω*

### Monostable Multivibrator
*T = 1.1 x R X C*

For pulse width,T= 0.5 ms and C = 1 µF

*R = 0.5/1.1 x 10^-6 = 454.54 Ω*

### 7. INFERENCE
- We saw that changing the resistor and capacitor values in a 555 timer changes how long the output stays ON and OFF. But with the basic 555 setup, we can’t always get the exact ON/OFF times we want.
- Sometimes, like when we need the OFF time to be longer than the ON time, the normal 555 astable circuit doesn’t give the right output directly. That’s why in Case 3, we used an inverter to flip the signal.
- By adding a simple NOT gate (made using a transistor), we could reverse the signal. This helped us create the output timing we needed more easily.
- In Case 2, we used very short pulses (less than a millisecond). To make that work, we used small resistor and capacitor values. This showed how important it is to choose the right and precise components for accurate timing.
- A differentiator circuit helped us spot the exact moment when the input signal goes from LOW to HIGH. This is useful when we want to respond only to the change, not the full length of the pulse.
