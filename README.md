<br>
If the power dessipation is 100um across the resistor and voltage is 1.8V
<br>
power=V*I
<br>
I=power/Voltage
<br>
  =100um/1.8V
  <br>

The output load line equation is

when we replace the value of drain resistor is 2.75k ohms, then  calculated current value does not match the simulated value and fixed the mosfet length value at 180nm and
vary the width to get exact current value

In this ananlysis we determines the gain.to obtain the sinusoidal voltage signal put peak to peak value is 50mV and frequency is 1kHz and Ac amplitude is 1v and select the stop time 3ms
<br>
The voltage gain is calculated as:
<br>
Gain =<b> V<sub> out</b>/<b> V<sub> in</b>
<br>
<b> A<sub> v</b>=33.48dB
<br>
this value matches the theoritical value which is calculated by:
<br>
<b> A<sub> v</b>=<b> G<sub> m</b><b> R<sub> d</b>
<br>
The output waveform is an amplified and inverted version of the input.
A 180Â° phase shift is observed in the ouyput.
The circuit amplifies without severe distortion, confirming MOSFET operation in saturation.

<br>
In this analysis we determines the frequency responce and In  simulation we set the sweep to decade and put staring frequency is 1Hz and stop frequency is 1THz
<br>
At low frequency , the amplifier maintains the  high voltage gain and as frequency increses thre gain starts to decresing due to internal MOSFET capacitance
<br>
<b>Result:</b>
<br>
In DC analysis theoritically we calculated Id value is 55.5um and from the load line we calucated Rd =2.72k ohm
<br>
In Transient analysis we calculated and obtained the gain is -33.48 dB
<br>
In AC analysis 
<br>
<b> Inference:</b>
<br>
<b>DC Analysis :</b>
In dc analysis we  determine the biasing point (Q-point)and we confirm that MOSFRT operates in the saturation region
<br>
<b> Transient Analysis :</b>
Common source amplifier amplifies the 1kHz,50mV input signal and  gain is 15 and 180 degree phase shift at the output.
<br>
<b>AC Analysis :</b>
The frequency sweep from 0.1Hz to 1THz shows that beyond a certain frequency the amplifier loses its ability to amplify effectivily.
and at low frequency it gives the high gain .

  We give a frequency 1kHz and give input as sine wave and 50mV peak amplitude and 0.9V DC offset was applied.The output peak voltage was measured as 1.751V of the sine wave.There is 180 degree phase shift between input and output or the DC level shift.
  <br>

  <br>
 
  <br>![c3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc0e0bf2-a866-435b-8914-92d513f3d866)

   The circuit shows a gain of 14dB and    Frequency: 23.614G Hz.
   <br>
   <b> Inference:</b>
   <br>
   1.The Current Id is dependent on width and hence it changes when the width changes whereas the remaining parameters remain constany.
   <br>
   2.DC operating point analysis cofirmed that the MOSFET operates in saturation region. The observed drain voltage (1.18V) and the drain current(55uA) align with theoretical values.
   <br>
   3.Transient analysis verified that the circuit amplifies the input 1k Hz sine wave with minimal distortion.There is 180 degree phase shift between input and output or the DC level shift.
   <br>
   4.In AC analysis we determine the frequency response by applying the small signal analysis to the circuit . We do this analysis to check in which frequency the circuit acts as the linear amplifier.
