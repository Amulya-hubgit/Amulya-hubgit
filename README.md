# **Report on DC,Transient analysis and AC analysis of a Common Source Amplifier**
## **Introduction:**
</p>     In this experiment we do the the analysis of common source amplifier 
and common source amplifier is the one used widely in the mosfet amplifier and it gives the 
high voltage gain and it's applications are audio amplifier, signal processing and communication circuits
<br> In this Experiment we do the DC,Tranisient analysis and AC analysis
dc.<br>
<b> DC Analysis:</b>
In this analysis we determines the biasing point(Q-point) of the MOSFET and ensuring it operates in the saturation region
<br>
<b> AC analysis:</b>
